// ============================================================================
// Launcher <-> MainWindow switching
// ============================================================================
// SpeedyNote switches between the Launcher and a MainWindow by showing one
// top-level window and hiding the other. That is an ordinary z-order change
// everywhere except HarmonyOS, where a top-level window is an *ability instance*
// and the platform gives Qt no way to bring a backgrounded one forward:
//
//   - Qt backs hide()/show() of a top-level with the platform's minimize() and
//     restore(). minimize() works; restore() is a PC/2-in-1-only call that a
//     tablet refuses outright ("Restore: This is not PC or PcAppInPad, not
//     supported"), so the pair is a one-way door. Hiding either window made the
//     app look like it had vanished, which was the original bug. Declaring only
//     "tablet;2in1" does not help -- the check is about the hardware, not the
//     manifest -- and crashed the app on a tablet besides.
//   - hideAbility()/showAbility(), which Qt prefers when available, fail too
//     (error 16000067), so there is nothing to fall back to.
//   - Raising does not help either: QWidget::raise() reaches showWindow(), which
//     orders windows *within* an instance that is already foreground.
//
// So the app keeps a single ability instance. The Launcher is the one that owns
// it -- it is the app's first window and outlives every MainWindow -- and each
// MainWindow is tagged as a *sub-window* of it (adoptAsLauncherSubWindow) rather
// than being allowed to become an instance of its own. Sub-windows live in their
// parent's stage, so both directions of the switch are ordinary z-order changes
// again: raise() reaches raiseToAppTop(), and hide() is a real hide instead of a
// minimise. The task switcher shows one entry, and the ability manager is not
// involved in a switch at all.
//
// The Launcher itself must still never be hidden, because hiding *it* would
// minimise the instance -- hence mustStayResident().
//
// This lives under harmony/ because HarmonyOS is the only reason it exists, but
// it is built on every platform: the show/raise/geometry sequence is shared, and
// only the hide is conditional.

// its frame, because a MainWindow there is a sub-window: the platform puts it
// exactly where asked and applies no status-bar inset of its own, so the
// Launcher's laid-out rect is the only thing that knows where the status bar

// a state nobody can see bounce between the two windows -- and a window shown
// "fullscreen" skips the geometry targetGeometry() worked out, which is what

// True when the Launcher, rather than a MainWindow, is the front window.

// stays visible while it sits behind a MainWindow, so visibility cannot answer
// the question and the direction recorded by switchTo() is used instead.
